## Description

> While conducting a physical security assessment, you found where the
> server room was located inside the facility, but it was locked.  
> You didn't want to get your lock picks out and start picking to avoid
> drawing attention from the security guard.  
> Fortunately for you, the network engineer working there had posted a
> picture online that looked a bit unusual.  
> Your task is to reproduce a copy of the key that unlocks the door to the
> server room, but first, you need to determine its brand and the bitting
> code.  
> PS: It should be the biggest one in his keyring.
> Flag is in the following format: shellmates{`BRAND`-`BITTINGCODE`}  
> `BRAND`: The complete name of the brand, all uppercase, only letters.  
> `BITTINGCODE`: A decimal number representing the key bittings, the leftmost
> digit being the code of the first key bitting.
