  > During a forensics operation, you have been asked to perform a [cold boot attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack).  
  > You take the attacker's machine and use your freeze spray on the RAM. You plug your bootable USB and reboot the computer in order to perform the attack.

  > Your goal is to recover the KEY. You already know what algorithm is that...
